## EduMaster

**What does the application do?**

EduMaster if a financial management software for school administrators to better keep record of monetary transactions
with students and teachers. It will allow the often manual, time-consuming task of managing tuition fees and salaries to
be done in more efficiently. School administrators will have a better understanding of their cash flows that are needed 
to make important management decisions.

The user can register new students or teachers into the database on demand, as well as see what courses each student is
enrolled in and what courses each teacher teaches. The tuition fees due from each student and the salaries due to
teachers are periodically accrued such that users can view at any time the status of all cash inflows and outflows. 
When a student pays his/her fees, or a teacher receives a salary, the transaction can be recorded in the application
against the outstanding amounts. Users also have the option to view the school's entire transaction history with a 
particular student or teacher.

**Why?**

This project capitalizes on my love for business administration! As a Business & Computer Science student at UBC, I 
wanted to incorporate the other half of my studies at Sauder into this project. Although accounting is one of the
most popular specializations in business, it is also indisputably one of the most tedious and repetitive. Accountants
and other financial managers often have very tedious expense management tasks that involve monitoring daily company
transactions. Any software that can make their tasks easier are high in demand, so I wanted to start 
with an application that is simple but in the field of financial management.
